                <p>I was born in Rome, and moved to the US when I was eight. I lived in Arlington, Virginia (DC area) for most of my life, until I went to Virginia Tech to pursue a Bachelor's Degree in Hospitality and Tourism Management. At this point I
                    did not really know what I wanted to do in life, but I knew I loved to travel, love people, and have a diverse background. Virginia Tech also had a World Ranked Hospitality program, which brought out my competitive side.</p>

                <p>
                    <h3>Hawaii</h3>Once I graduated Virginia Tech I was accepted into Hitlon’s Top Management Development Program. I was given the privilege to work at some of the most amazing resorts in Hawaii with some wonderful people. Although this sounds
                    like a dream, and it was, it was also very tough. Every week was +50 hours, with numerous night shifts, irate guests, and holidays were very rarely spent with family. However, I would not give that experience back for anything, as
                    I learned a lot, and have some amazing memories.
                    <p/>
                    <p>
                        <h3>The Big Apple Fast </h3>forward three years (2019), and I made a big jump to NY. Completely different atmosphere, but surprisingly less challenging for me personally. As I worked in a Wall Street Hotel, most of the guests were
                        business travelers. The hotel was also almost perfect, which made the day to day very smooth. However this is when I started to really explore what I was looking for in life. </p>

                    <p>
                        <h3>WHY I LEFT A SECURE CORPORATE JOB TO PURSUE CS? </h3>During my exploration stage in life I truly thought about what I wanted at a personal level. I listened to many Ted Talks to help me find the answer, and one particular talk
                        with Elizabeth Gilbert made things clear for me. What I want in life is to learn, and develop myself and others around me. At this point I started looking at different topics that interested me. Having the privilege of being in
                        NY I got to try all kinds of things including Jazz Classes, Language Classes, Yoga, and more….</p>

                    <p>I finally started to explore the fascinating tech industry that makes up so much of our life today. I had never thought of coding as a possibility for me, however I started looking into it, and thinking why not. I have a curious mind,
                        passion for learning, nack for critical thinking, and I’m fascinated by the control the web has on the world today. At this point I started reading up on career transitions, and what a job in the CS would look like.</p>

                    <p>I met a few people that had done bootcamps, and were very successful. I also started listening to Laurence Bradford’s “Learn to Code With Me” podcast, which was extremely inspirational. I joined Meetup, and started going to coding
                        events to see if this was an environment I could see myself in. Additionally I was taking CodeCademy courses, and Udemy classes to see if the passion was really there. </p>

                    <p>Once I was confident this was the right move for me I started to look at what options I had, and what my timeline would look like if I were to make this jump. To make things clear this was still very scary. I had a secure job that
                        guaranteed me comfort for life, and my family apprehensive due to the uncertainty. Nonetheless I moved forward.</p>
